# Monumental take-home assignment
Repository to create a masonary wall with a 4-DOF robotic crane.

## Install the requirements
Install the ```requirements.txt``` note that it is assumed you already have python installed on your machine.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```
Note that I use Manim (https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) for the vizualisations. Manim is a community-maintained Python framework for creating mathematical animations originally developed by Grant Sanderson. I ave used it in the past for some science communication animations so I decided to use it again for this project.

## Initial testing
The notebook ```Testing_notebook.ipynb``` can be ignored. It created to get a feel for the problem and test out the build orders.
